# Hangman
Project: Hangman Game in Python

This project implements a classic hangman game using the Python programming language. The game selects a random word from a corpus of English words provided by the NLTK library. The user must guess the letters of the word, with a limited number of incorrect attempts. With each incorrect attempt, a part of the hangman drawing is displayed. The game ends when the user correctly guesses the word or when the hangman drawing is complete, signifying a loss. The project incorporates basic programming concepts such as loops, conditionals, lists, and strings, and aims to be a fun introduction to interactive programming in Python.
